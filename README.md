# Student Management System
This is a simple student management system written in Java. It allows users to add, delete, and update student information, as well as view student data and calculate average marks.

## Technical Elements
### Student Class
The Student class has three private instance variables: name, rollNumber, and marks. It also has a constructor that initializes these variables. Additionally, it has getter and setter methods for these variables.

### StudentDatabase Class
The StudentDatabase class is responsible for managing the collection of Student objects. It has methods to add a new student, delete a student, update a student's marks, print student data, and calculate average marks. These methods use a list of Student objects to store the student data.

### StudentManagementSystem Class
The StudentManagementSystem class is the main class of the program. It instantiates a new StudentDatabase object and adds some initial data to it. It then displays a menu and prompts the user to select an option. Depending on the user's choice, it calls the appropriate method of the StudentDatabase class.
